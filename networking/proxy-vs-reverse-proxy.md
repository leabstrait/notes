# Proxy Server

| Aspect            | Proxy                                                                                                                                                                    | Reverse Proxy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Definition        | Acts as an intermediary between client and server, forwarding client requests to the server and relaying server responses back to the client.                            | Serves as an intermediary between clients and multiple backend servers, distributing client requests to the appropriate server and relaying server responses back to clients.                                                                                             |
| Use Cases         | 1. Access control and filtering. <br> 2. Anonymity and privacy. <br> 3. Caching and load balancing.                                                                      | 1. Load balancing for high availability. <br> 2. SSL termination (handling encryption). <br> 3. Security and protection for backend servers. <br> 4. Caching and compression.                                                                                             |
| Technical Details | - Clients connect to the proxy. <br> - Proxy forwards client requests to the server. <br> - Server responds to proxy. <br> - Proxy relays server response to the client. | - Clients connect to the reverse proxy. <br> - Reverse proxy decides which backend server to forward the request to. <br> - Backend server processes the request and sends the response to the reverse proxy. <br> - Reverse proxy sends the response back to the client. |
| Client Perception | Clients are usually aware of the proxy's existence and intentionally route their traffic through it.                                                                     | Clients are often unaware of the reverse proxy's presence, as they connect to it directly, and the reverse proxy forwards their requests to backend servers.                                                                                                              |
| Load Balancing    | Typically doesn't involve load balancing across multiple servers.                                                                                                        | Primarily used for load balancing to distribute incoming requests across multiple backend servers.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| SSL Handling      | May or may not handle SSL encryption/decryption.                                                                                                                         | Often handles SSL termination (decrypting SSL traffic and forwarding it unencrypted to backend servers).                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Security          | Can provide some security by filtering and blocking content.                                                                                                             | Provides security by shielding backend servers from direct exposure to the internet, preventing direct attacks on them.                                                                                                                                                   |
| Caching           | Can implement caching to store and serve frequently requested content.                                                                                                   | Can cache content to reduce server load and improve response times.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Examples          | - Web proxies. <br> - Content filtering proxies. <br> - Transparent proxies.                                                                                             | - Nginx. <br> - Apache HTTP Server (with mod_proxy). <br> - HAProxy.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
